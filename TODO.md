# Future Improvements

## High Priority
- [ ] Implement Google search + YouTube link scraping instead of direct YouTube API search for better discovery
- [ ] Better database analysis and querying methods (advanced filters, aggregations, insights)
- [ ] Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for vector database queries to improve search quality
- [ ] LLM-based feedback loops and result validation system for quality assurance

## Medium Priority  
- [ ] Implement better feedback system when AI query doesn't provide results or transcript isn't available - generate different queries until hitting the number of videos mark
- [ ] Do proper check on the parallel processing implementation
- [ ] Store view count along with trustworthiness score to show how trendy the observations are
- [ ] Design better more refined prompts for AI queries

## Low Priority
- [ ] Use results to generate a vector database and extract results from there *(COMPLETED)*
