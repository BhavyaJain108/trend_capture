# Future Improvements

## High Priority
- [ ] Implement better feedback system when AI query doesn't provide results or transcript isn't available - generate different queries until hitting the number of videos mark
- [ ] Use results to generate a vector database and extract results from there

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Do proper check on the parallel processing implementation
- [ ] Store view count along with trustworthiness score to show how trendy the observations are
- [ ] Design better more refined prompts for AI queries
